Regional & Macro Context
Southeast Asia HealthTech total funding (10 years): USD 1.48 billion across the sector; peak funding year was 2023 at USD 416 million [Tracxn, 2025]
Southeast Asia HealthTech (Jan–Aug 2025): USD 42.1 million across 14 rounds, down slightly from USD 47.9 million in the same period of 2024 [Tracxn, 2025]
Asia-Pacific digital health funding (2024): USD 2 billion across 244 deals — a 19% decline from 2023's USD 2.8 billion, primarily driven by a pullback in China [Galen Growth, 2025]
Top funded therapeutic area in APAC (2024): Oncology (USD 434M), Geriatrics (USD 291M), Neurology (USD 220M) [Galen Growth, 2025]
Global digital health VC funding (2024): USD 10.1 billion across 497 deals (down from USD 10.8B in 2023, but above pre-pandemic USD 8.2B in 2019); average deal size USD 20.4 million [Rock Health / FierceHealthcare, Jan 2025]
Insight: The 2024 funding correction in SEA and APAC reflects a global macro reset after the 2020–2022 boom, not a fundamental loss of confidence in digital health. Early-stage deal activity remains active. For Malaysia specifically, the Valiance Health investment (February 2026) signals that AI-in-healthcare infrastructure is the next frontier attracting capital.
