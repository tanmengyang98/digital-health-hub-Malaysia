### Challenges
1. 💸 Reimbursement Gap — The Payor Problem
Malaysia's most structurally entrenched digital health barrier is the absence of systematic insurance reimbursement for digital health interventions. The market is currently a two-tier problem:
In the public sector, digital health solutions do not have dedicated budget line items under the Ministry of Health. The public sector budget is allocated toward facilities, human resources, and medications — not software-as-a-service clinical tools or digital therapeutics. [Global Institute, Oct 2025]
In the private sector, while insurance penetration is growing, only ~45% of Malaysians have personal health insurance (with the NHMS 2019 suggesting it may be as low as 22%). [CodeBlue, Dec 2024] Of those who lack coverage, 43% say they cannot afford it. The situation is further complicated by a medical inflation rate that hit 12.6% in 2023, prompting Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) to mandate a minimum 5% co-payment requirement in new medical and health insurance products from September 2024 — a structural shift that is making insurance access harder, not easier, for lower-income groups. [CodeBlue, Dec 2024]
For digital health specifically, no reimbursement codes for digital therapeutics exist in Malaysia. Compare this to Germany's DiGA programme, which from 2020–2024 drove nearly 861,000 activations across 64 digital therapeutic products at roughly €271 per use — far below the cost of untreated downstream complications [Nature npj Digital Medicine, Dec 2025] — or the US, where CMS approved three new Digital Mental Health Treatment (DMHT) reimbursement codes in November 2024. [APA, Nov 2025]
Impact on startups: Without a reimbursement pathway, most B2C digital health startups are forced to compete on affordability in a price-sensitive market, or pivot to B2B (corporate wellness) like Naluri — which works for a limited addressable market but does not scale to population health.

2. 📜 Regulatory Uncertainty — The Digital Health Act Gap
As of February 2026, Malaysia still lacks a permanent, comprehensive legal framework for digital health. The OHS RegLab guidelines — which governed telemedicine practices from 2022–2023 — lapsed at the end of 2023 and are now used only as a de facto industry standard in the absence of formal law. [The Edge Malaysia, May 2025]
The forthcoming Digital Health Act, under development by the MOH Digital Health Division, is expected to cover telemedicine, e-prescriptions, digital therapeutics, AI-in-healthcare, and data governance. However, there is no clear enactment date, and previous digital health legislation (the Telemedicine Act 1997) sat largely unimplemented for decades. [PMC — Evolution of Malaysia Healthcare Digitalisation, 2025]
The Medical Device Authority (MDA) classifies some digital health software as medical devices but the pathway for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) is unclear. There is no equivalent of Singapore's HSA framework for SaMD or the FDA's DeNovo pathway for AI/ML-based tools. This ambiguity makes companies hesitant to invest in regulated product categories — or drives them to launch in Singapore or Australia first and re-enter Malaysia later. [Ken Research, 2026]
There is also currently no law or regulation that explicitly governs patient data in the context of healthcare. The PDPA 2010 applies broadly but was not designed for health data. The Health PSSC has recommended MOH review existing laws, but no health-specific data law has been enacted. [Global Institute, Oct 2025]

3. 🌐 Digital Divide — The Infrastructure Reality
Despite Malaysia's impressive national statistics (97.4% internet penetration), the quality gap between urban and rural connectivity is severe and directly limits digital health reach:
Rural household internet access is 90.3% vs. urban 98.8% [DOSM ICT Survey, 2024] — but coverage statistics do not capture connection quality or bandwidth
Half of Malaysians report experiencing poor internet connectivity, according to a SCMP-cited report [Global Institute, Oct 2025]
Indigenous Orang Asli communities and deep rural East Malaysia remain connectivity dead zones — exactly the populations with the least access to specialist care and the greatest potential benefit from digital health
Clinic hardware and power infrastructure in rural settings is frequently inadequate for digital solutions
Only 3% of health clinics have adopted digital health records as of 2024, meaning the backend infrastructure for any interoperability-based solution is near-absent [Global Institute, Oct 2025]

4. 🩺 Clinician Adoption — The Human Barrier
Clinician acceptance is a recognised major barrier to digital health implementation globally, and Malaysia's physician community demonstrates patterns consistent with international evidence:
A 2020 cross-sectional survey among Malaysian doctors found that only 22% reported using telemedicine for consultation during COVID-19, despite the pandemic providing maximum motivation. While 76.7% found telemedicine useful in pandemic-like situations, the majority estimated it would only benefit up to 30% of their patient population. The top barriers cited were: medico-legal issues due to lack of proper legislation, lack of reimbursement standardisation, technical difficulties, and patient education challenges. Notably, 43.8% had no knowledge of the Telemedicine Act 1997 — the primary legal framework for their practice. [PMC — Perception of Telemedicine among Malaysian Practitioners, 2021]
A 2023 study at a MOH tertiary hospital found that 29.1% of healthcare workers would not consider telemedicine without prior physical interaction with patients. Barriers included how vital direct physical interaction is perceived to be, technological limitations, internet challenges, and feelings that tools are impersonal or prone to error. [PMC — Telemedicine Perception and Readiness, 2023]
Structural factors compounding resistance include: the absence of digital health in medical school curricula — a 2025 Lancet study found that Malaysia's medical education includes only basic topics like EMR and telemedicine while falling short of comprehensive digital health education, and that curricular reform faces barriers including crowded course schedules, shortage of faculty with digital health expertise, and institutional resistance to change. [The Lancet Regional Health – Western Pacific, Jan 2025] A 2025 systematic review further confirmed that eHealth adoption in Malaysia remains low due to high implementation costs, privacy concerns, limited training, low health literacy, and resource constraints. [Taylor & Francis — Factors influencing eHealth adoption in Malaysia, 2025]

5. 🔌 Data Fragmentation & Interoperability
Patient data in Malaysia is siloed across thousands of separate institutions using different systems, different data standards, and no common exchange protocol. The current state:
Only ~14% of public hospitals are digitalised; 6.8% of primary clinics have connected digital records [Healthcare IT News, 2025]
The national Health Information Exchange (HIE) is still transitioning from MyHIX to an HL7 FHIR-based platform — and is not yet operational at scale
Private and public sectors have incompatible systems, preventing the continuity-of-care data flow that AI diagnostics, population health tools, and RPM platforms depend on
This data scarcity is simultaneously the biggest barrier to building AI-powered clinical tools for Malaysia and the biggest reason AI solutions trained elsewhere cannot be directly deployed here

6. 🏥 Small Funding Rounds & Thin VC Ecosystem
Malaysia's digital health startup ecosystem faces structural funding disadvantages:
Most Malaysian digital health deals are below USD 5 million at seed/Series A — far below Singapore's typical USD 10–50 million rounds
There are few Malaysia-based VCs with dedicated healthcare thesis; the ecosystem depends heavily on regional funds (Gobi Partners, Integra, EV Growth) which compare investment opportunities across the entire ASEAN market
No major digital health M&A exits or IPOs have occurred from Malaysia-origin companies yet, limiting the exit track record that would attract more institutional capital
Southeast Asian healthtech funding fell 79% in 2024 to USD 123 million (from the prior peak) — a macro correction that disproportionately affects early-stage Malaysian companies trying to raise their first institutional round [Tracxn / Smart Health Asia, Feb 2026]
