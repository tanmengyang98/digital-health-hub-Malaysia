## What's Not Working
❌ 1. EMR Rollout — Decades of Ambition, Minimal Progress
The evidence: Malaysia first proposed the Lifetime Health Record concept in its 1997 Telemedicine Blueprint. After nearly 30 years, only ~14% of public hospitals are digitalised, 6.8% of primary healthcare clinics have connected digital records, and just 0.7% of rural and community clinics have any form of digital records. Only 3% of all health clinics have adopted digital health records as of 2024. [Healthcare IT News, 2025] [Global Institute, Oct 2025]
Why it's failing:
Decades of the "build" model produced bespoke, expensive systems that became difficult to maintain; MOH has only recently shifted to a "subscription" model [Healthcare IT News, 2025]
No single regulatory body mandated universal EMR adoption — unlike Singapore, which is pushing the Health Information Bill to legally mandate NEHR contribution [MOH Singapore, 2024]
Fragmented legacy systems in public hospitals are technically incompatible, making integration efforts costly and slow
Insufficient internal MOH IT capability to execute at scale — hence the shift toward vendor subscription models

❌ 2. Digital Health Education Gap — A Workforce That Isn't Ready
The evidence: A 2025 study in The Lancet Regional Health – Western Pacific found a systematic disconnect between Malaysia's medical education and the country's digital health ambitions. Medical schools include only limited topics (EMR, basic telemedicine) while falling far short of comprehensive digital health competencies. The barriers to reform include crowded curricular space, faculty shortages in digital health, infrastructure constraints, and institutional resistance. [The Lancet, Jan 2025]
Why it matters: A physician who graduates with no training in how to evaluate an AI diagnostic tool, interpret remote monitoring data, or understand the limitations of algorithmic decision support is not equipped to champion or safely adopt digital health in their clinical workflow. Until medical education systematically incorporates digital health competencies, clinician adoption will remain an uphill battle driven by individual enthusiasts rather than system-wide transformation.

❌ 3. Data Governance Vacuum — No Trust Architecture
The evidence: There is currently no law specifically governing patient health data in Malaysia — the PDPA 2010 applies generally but was not designed for healthcare. The Digital Health Malaysia Conference 2025 identified data governance and interoperability as the primary unresolved issue requiring an "actionable framework", involving policymakers, regulators, insurers, and tech providers. [DHM Conference, 2025]
Why it's failing:
Without a clear legal framework specifying who owns health data, what can be shared, and under what consent model, neither patients nor clinicians are willing to fully trust digital health systems
Insurance companies cannot build data-driven products without standardised, legally protected data flows
AI and analytics companies cannot train models on Malaysian patient data without clear legal authority to access and use it
The problem is circular: without data, you can't build good AI; without good AI, the case for digital health investment is weaker

❌ 4. The Interoperability Gap — ASEAN-Wide Problem
The evidence: Most ASEAN countries, including Malaysia, operate health systems in data silos with no standardised data formats and no shared protocols across institutions. [East Asia Forum, Mar 2025] The ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025 (ADM 2025) itself lacks a clear strategy or outcomes specifically linked to digital health. [KAS, 2024]
Why it's failing:
Data standards are not mandated — there is no Malaysian equivalent of Synapxe's SS719:2025 and SS720:2025 national health data interoperability standards, which Singapore published in October 2025 to enable system-to-system data exchange [GovInsider Asia, Oct 2025]
Private sector resistance: hospitals view patient data as a competitive asset and have incentives to prevent portability
The public-private divide creates a fundamental structural barrier — a patient treated at a public hospital and then referred to a private specialist starts with a blank record
