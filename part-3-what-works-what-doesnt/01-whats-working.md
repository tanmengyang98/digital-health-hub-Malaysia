## What's Working
✅ 1. Telemedicine — Clear Regulatory Momentum & Proven Demand
What the evidence says: The number of patients accessing telehealth services in Malaysian community pharmacies surged from fewer than 10,000 in 2019 to over 300,000 in 2022 — a 30-fold increase in three years. [The Lancet, Jan 2025] Approximately 1.5 million adults used at least one type of online healthcare service in 2023. [NHMS 2023 via The Lancet, Jan 2025]
Why it's succeeding:
COVID-19 created permanent behavioural change — patients experienced virtual care and found it acceptable for low-acuity conditions
The OHS RegLab (2022–2023) provided a functioning interim framework, giving companies room to operate legitimately even before permanent legislation
The Malaysian Medical Council updated its Telemedicine Guideline in January 2024, providing updated clinical protocols [CodeBlue, Mar 2024]
MOH has provided telemedicine platforms to all 900 public health clinics nationwide for virtual follow-up care and prenatal consultations [CodeBlue, Feb 2025]
Malaysia was among the first countries in ASEAN to launch a telemedicine policy (Telemedicine Blueprint, 1997), giving it a structural head-start in practitioner awareness [Global Institute, Oct 2025]

✅ 2. Mental Health Tech — Stigma Reduction Through Anonymity & Corporate Adoption
What the evidence shows: Depression prevalence in Malaysia doubled from 2.3% in 2019 to 4.6% in 2023, with peak rates among working-age adults 20–39. [Bernama / NHMS 2023, 2024] Mental ill-health has been the leading cause of disability in Malaysia since 1990. [Malaysian Health & Wellness Summit, Aug 2024]
Why it's succeeding:
Digital-first, anonymous delivery lowers the social stigma barrier significantly — Malaysians who would not walk into a psychiatric clinic will engage with a chat-based mental health coach
Naluri's B2B corporate wellness model is commercially proven: corporate health budgets expanded markedly post-COVID, and employers face clear productivity and absenteeism costs from untreated mental health conditions
The government's recognition of mental health as a priority — through the National Strategic Plan for Mental Health 2021–2025 and inclusion in the Health White Paper — signals a systemic shift even if budgets remain constrained
TELUS Health's 2024 strategic partnership with Naluri to serve Employee Assistance Programs across 8 Asian markets demonstrates that multinational companies are willing to pay for evidence-based programmes [MobiHealthNews, 2024]

✅ 3. Private Hospital Digital Innovation — Smart Hospital Leadership
What the evidence shows:
Institut Jantung Negara (IJN) became the first Malaysian public-sector hospital to achieve HIMSS EMRAM Stage 6 — a globally recognised standard for electronic medical record maturity [Ken Research, 2026]
ParkCity Medical Centre won the Smart Hospital Initiative of the Year and Sunway Home Healthcare won Home-care Initiative of the Year at the Healthcare Asia Awards 2024 [PMC, 2025]
Malaysia's Smart Hospitals Market is valued at approximately USD 1.5 billion, reflecting meaningful private sector investment in hospital digitisation [Ken Research, 2026]
Why it's succeeding:
Healthcare tourism competition with Singapore and Thailand incentivises Malaysian private hospitals to maintain world-class digital standards to attract international patients
Private sector has the financial flexibility to make capital investments in smart hospital infrastructure without public procurement constraints
International accreditation bodies (HIMSS, JCI) create external market pressure for digital standards adoption

✅ 4. Government Infrastructure Commitment — Policy Backing with Funding
What the evidence shows: The MOH has committed RM 150 million (USD 31M) to IT system expansion [Trade.gov / ITA, 2024] and established a dedicated Digital Health Division in March 2024 — the first ministerial body of its kind. Malaysia was recognised at the 2024 World Health Assembly for being one of only three countries globally (alongside Indonesia and Oman) to implement the International Patient Summary (IPS) programme for Hajj pilgrims. [CodeBlue, Feb 2025]
Why it's succeeding:
The Health White Paper (2023) is a 15-year parliamentary commitment, giving the sector long-term policy certainty
Digital health has strong ministerial champions — Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad and DH Division head Dr. Mahesh have been consistent and credible advocates
Malaysia's participation in the WHO IPS programme creates an international accountability mechanism that incentivises follow-through
