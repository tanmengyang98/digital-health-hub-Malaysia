**Why I created this:**

During my transition from clinical medicine to health informatics, I struggled to find comprehensive, Malaysia-focused resources on digital health. This guide is what I wish existed when I started my journey.

My goal is to make digital health knowledge accessible to Malaysian healthcare practitioners who, like me, are curious about the intersection of medicine and technology.
