### Ministry of Health (MOH) Digital Health Strategy

1. MOH Digital Health Division (Established March 2024)
A dedicated Digital Health Division within MOH was established in March 2024, led by Dr. Maheshwara Rao Appannan (Dr. Mahesh). This is the first time Malaysia has had a formal policy body dedicated exclusively to digital health at the ministerial level.
The Division has four strategic priorities:
Developing the forthcoming Digital Health Act
Scaling the national EMR / "One Individual, One Record" programme
Overseeing telemedicine policy (post-OHS RegLab)
Pursuing digital health interoperability and Health Information Exchange (HIE) [Healthcare IT News, 2025] [The Edge Malaysia, May 2025]
2. "One Individual, One Record" — National EMR Programme
The MOH's flagship digital transformation project, championed by Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad, aims to give every Malaysian a single unified electronic health record accessible across both public and private facilities.
Current status (as of 2025):
~200 clinics are using cloud-based Clinic Management Systems (CCMS)
~15 hospitals are live on EMR; 16 more to follow
MOH has shifted from a "build" to "subscription" model, recognising limited internal capacity for bespoke system development
Only ~14% of public hospitals have been digitalised; only 6.8% of primary healthcare clinics are connected digitally; and just 0.7% of rural and community clinics have digital records [Healthcare IT News, 2025]
MOH has provided telemedicine platforms to all 900 public health clinics nationwide for virtual consultations, particularly for follow-up care and prenatal appointments. [CodeBlue, Feb 2025]
3. Online Healthcare Services Regulatory Lab (OHS RegLab) — 2022–2023
The OHS RegLab was launched by MOH in February 2022 in collaboration with Futurise Sdn Bhd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cyberview Sdn Bhd, under the Ministry of Finance), which manages the National Regulatory Sandbox. It allowed digital health companies to operate in a "live and controlled environment" monitored by regulators. [BusinessToday, Feb 2022]
More than 50 OHS industry players participated, including private hospitals, clinics, and tech companies
DoctorOnCall and BookDoc were among the participants of the first cohort
The OHS RegLab guidelines were revised twice within two years based on player feedback
Guidelines lapsed at end of 2023 but continue to be used as a stopgap in the absence of permanent regulation
These guidelines now form the basis of the forthcoming Digital Health Act [The Edge Malaysia, May 2025]
The OHS RegLab concept dates back to 2018, when it began as the Telemedicine Development Group (2016) → became Digital Health Malaysia (DHM) (2018) → formalised via MOH in 2020 → launched as OHS RegLab in February 2022. [The Edge Malaysia — Regulating the Online Healthcare Space]
4. MOH's Digital Health Strategy — Four Thrusts
MOH's digitalisation strategic plan outlines four strategic thrusts, 13 strategies, and 30 digitalisation programmes to be implemented across the ministry and its healthcare facilities. Key digital health initiatives from the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021–2025) include: [PMC, 2025]
Revival of the Lifetime Health Record (first proposed in the 1997 Telemedicine Blueprint)
Expansion of virtual clinic services
Development of mobile apps for appointment and medical record access
Implementation of e-hailing home-based healthcare services
IoT-enabled home-care monitoring and virtual consultations for the aging population
Enhancement of MyHDW (Malaysia Health Data Warehouse) with a virtual platform for cross-agency data sharing
5. Health White Paper (2023)
Malaysia's Parliament approved the MOH Health White Paper in 2023, outlining healthcare reforms over the next 15 years. Key digital components include phased EMR rollout, the Electronic Lifetime Health Record (ELHR), and a national Health Information Exchange (HIE). [US ITA / Trade.gov, 2024]
6. International Patient Summary (IPS) — WHO-Recognised Achievement
In 2023, MOH digitalised the health screening process for Hajj pilgrims. By 2024, Malaysia empowered pilgrims to share health records with facilities in Saudi Arabia. Malaysia was one of three countries (alongside Indonesia and Oman) to first implement the International Patient Summary (IPS) programme, which was recognised at the 2024 World Health Assembly. Dr. Mahesh has proposed using this same interoperability model for domestic cross-sector data sharing. [CodeBlue, Feb 2025]
7. NVIDIA–MRANTI AI Sandbox Pilot Programme (April 2024)
A strategic collaboration between MRANTI (Malaysian Research Accelerator for Technology and Innovation) and NVIDIA to establish an AI Sandbox under the National Technology and Innovation Sandbox (NTIS), with healthcare as a priority sector. [PMC, 2025]

Relevant Policies & Regulatory Framework
Telemedicine Act 1997
Malaysia enacted the Telemedicine Act 1997 under the 7th Malaysia Plan, one of the earliest such legislations in Southeast Asia. However, the act remained largely unimplemented for decades, as it was broad and lacked specific operational guidelines. [PMC, 2025]
Medical Act 1971 (Amended 2012)
Governs the registration and practice of medical practitioners; practitioners are also bound by the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC) Code of Professional Conduct. This is the primary legal framework currently governing practitioners who provide telemedicine services in the absence of OHS-specific legislation. [The Edge Malaysia]
Malaysian Medical Council (MMC) Guideline on Telemedicine (Updated January 2024)
The MMC updated its Guideline on Telemedicine in January 2024, providing clinical practitioners with updated guidance on conducting virtual consultations, prescribing protocols, and patient safety standards. [CodeBlue, Mar 2024]
Digital Health Act (Expected 2026 — Not Yet Passed)
The MOH's Digital Health Division is developing a dedicated Digital Health Act, targeted for enactment in 2026. The act is expected to provide comprehensive governance for telemedicine, e-prescriptions, digital therapeutics, AI-in-healthcare, and data governance. Until its passage, the lapsed OHS RegLab guidelines serve as the industry stopgap. [The Edge Malaysia, May 2025]
Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA)
The PDPA 2010 is Malaysia's primary data protection law and currently applies to digital health platforms handling patient personal data. The Health PSSC (Parliamentary Special Select Committee) has recommended MOH review existing laws to safeguard patient data and ensure information security, specifically that personal information should only be shared with individual consent. [CodeBlue, Feb 2025]
Medical Device Authority (MDA) Regulation
The Medical Device Authority (Pihak Berkuasa Peranti Perubatan) governs medical devices, including increasingly applicable to digital health software classified as medical devices. This creates a compliance pathway for some digital therapeutics — though the Digital Health Act is expected to create a clearer, dedicated framework. [Ken Research, 2026]
National Strategic Plan for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) 2022–2025
Includes digital health interventions as part of NCD management strategy, particularly relevant for telemedicine-enabled chronic disease follow-up and remote monitoring. [Trade.gov / ITA, 2024]
MSQH Digital Healthcare Standards (In Development — Expected End 2026)
The Malaysian Society for Quality in Health (MSQH) Accreditation Committee is developing Malaysia's first formal digital healthcare accreditation standards, to be published in the MSQH National Accreditation Programme by end 2026. The standards will cover telemedicine patient selection criteria (by clinical specialty), EMR/HMIS implementation, and crucially, interoperability guidelines. [Hospital Management Asia, May 2023]
