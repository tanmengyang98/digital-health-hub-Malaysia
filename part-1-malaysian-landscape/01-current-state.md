## Current State (2026)

### Market Maturity Assessment

The following assessment is based on the MOH digital health division's own disclosures, industry research, and observable market activity as of early 2026.
Segment
Maturity Level
Key Evidence
Telemedicine / Teleconsultation
🟡 Medium
Regulatory lab (OHS RegLab) operated 2022–2023; multiple commercial players active (DoctorOnCall, KonsultaMD, etc.); Digital Health Act expected 2026 [The Edge, 2025]
Electronic Medical Records (EMR)
🔴 Early
Only ~14% of hospitals digitalised; 6.8% of primary care clinics connected; 0.7% of rural clinics digital [Healthcare IT News, 2025]
Health Information Exchange
🔴 Early
MOH transitioning from MyHIX to HL7 FHIR-based HIE platform; "One Individual, One Record" project underway but not yet complete [LinkedIn / Azrin Zubir, 2024]
Mental Health Digital
🟡 Early-Medium
Naluri (B2B employee wellness) among established players; rising demand post-COVID; limited clinical integration
Chronic Disease Management
🟡 Early-Medium
Growing market; limited insurance reimbursement constraining B2C uptake
Digital Therapeutics
🔴 Very Early
No formal regulatory pathway; market valued at ~USD 220M (Ken Research estimate) [Ken Research, 2026]
Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)
🔴 Early
Largely pilot-stage; private hospitals (e.g., Sunway Home Healthcare) pioneering home-based models [PMC, 2025]
AI Diagnostics / Clinical AI
🔴 Early
Primarily academic research; NVIDIA–MRANTI AI Sandbox Pilot Programme launched April 2024 [PMC, 2025]
Smart Hospitals
🟡 Early-Medium
Malaysia Smart Hospitals Market valued at ~USD 1.5 billion; Institut Jantung Negara (IJN) first to achieve HIMSS EMRAM Stage 6 [Ken Research, 2026]
Rehabilitation Technology
🔴 Very Early
Minimal commercial offerings; largely absent from public health system

Overall assessment: Malaysia's digital health ecosystem is in the early-to-mid stage — consumer digital infrastructure is world-class, but healthcare backend infrastructure (EMR, interoperability, reimbursement) is significantly lagging. The gap between patient digital readiness and healthcare system readiness is the central tension defining this market.

Tracxn / Smart Health Asia, 2026

⚠️ Note on Southeast Asia Funding: The 79% funding decline in Southeast Asian healthtech in 2024 reflects broader macro-economic pressures and valuation corrections — not a collapse in the underlying opportunity. Early-stage innovation remains active; the correction primarily affected late-stage, high-valuation rounds.
